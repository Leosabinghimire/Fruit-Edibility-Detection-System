# Fruit Edibility Detection System

This is a machine learning-based system designed to detect the edibility of fruits using image recognition techniques. It classifies fruits as edible or non-edible based on visual cues such as texture and shape.

## Project Details
- **Language**: Python
- **Tools**: Jupyter Notebook, TensorFlow, Keras
- **Dataset**: A dataset of fruits images, used for training and testing the model.

## Usage
1. Clone the repository.
2. Install the required packages using `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
3. Run the `project.ipynb` Jupyter notebook to start the classification process.
